CoDa,Cooperation Databank,An annotated history of empirical studies on human cooperation in social dilemmas. Social Dilemmas are situations that involve a conflict of interests and people must choose between a behavior that is best for themselves and a behavior that is best for the collective. Cooperation is choosing to do a behavior that is best for the collective. CoDa contains six decades of studies on individual decision making in dyads and groups facing social dilemmas.The databank contains studies on human cooperation published in Chinese  English  and Japanese. Experts annotated these studies for 275 variables  including the quantitative results (effect sizes). We developed an ontology that defines and relates concepts in cooperation research and that can represent the relationships between individual study results. We have created an application that allows users to search the databank  and enables users to retrieve studies that test the relation of variables with cooperation  visualize these study results  and perform (1) meta-analyses  (2) meta-regressions  (3) estimates of publication bias  and (4) statistical power analyses for future studies.,Psychology; Sociology; Economics; Cooperation research; Prisoner's dilemma; Public Goods Game; Resource Dilemma; social dilemmas,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/CoDa,cultural heritage,intangible,DESC,NO,,cultural heritage,not classified

anno0000018da2d42240,ANNO,The Anthropological Notation Ontology (ANNO) allows the systematic and standardized classification of recovered bone finds into the skeletal system  the description of the skeletal pieces  and the definition of functions for the derivation of different phenotypes of humans in forensic and historical anthropology. ANNO consists of two components: ANNOdc  a domain-core ontology providing core entities such as basic anatomical categories  and ANNOds  a domain-specific ontology used for annotating structures of the human skeleton. ANNO is integrated into AnthroWorks3D  a photogrammetry pipeline and application for the creation and analysis of 3D-models of human skeletal remains. The integration is based on the three-ontology method with the General Formal Ontology as the top-level ontology  ANNOdc as the task ontology and ANNOds as the domain ontology. Thus  AnthroWorks3D only needs to implement access to the entities (classes and properties) of the task ontology  whereas the entities of the corresponding domain ontology are imported dynamically. ANNO supports the analysis of skeletal and bone finds in forensic and historical anthropology  facilitating the standardization of data annotation and ensuring accurate preservation of information for posterity.,anthropology,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/anno,cultural heritage,intangible,DESC,NO,,cultural heritage,health

dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei0000018da796a714,Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND),"GND stands for ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (Integrated Authority File) and offers a broad range of elements to describe authorities. The GND originates from the German library community and aims to solve the name ambiguity problem in the library world. Corresponding data is usually expressed in a customized MARC 21 Authority Format (GND MARC Format) which is quite domain specific and is not used beyond the library and publisher world. The GND ontology tries to bridge this gap by providing a format specification for the usage in the semantic web.  The need for name disambiguity and entries having an authoritative character is an issue that concerns a lot more communities than the library world. In a growing information society the unique identification and linking of persons  places and other authorities becomes more and more important. The GND Ontology aims to transfer the made experience from libraries to the web community by providing a vocabulary for the description of differentiated and undifferentiated persons  conferences or events  corporate bodies  places or geographic names  subject headings  and works.  To ensure compatibility aspects the GND ontology aligns a number of already established vocabularies like the FOAF vocabulary.  The GND is a young specification that probably will underlie certain smaller changes. However  the currently defined classes and properties have a status of stability. But we also expect the introduction of additional elements caused by newly upcoming requirements within the community. From January 2014 on  the Linked Data Service of the German National Library (DNB) will issue scheduled releases and will be integrated in the export releases of the other formats. Changes to the conversion and to the data modelling will be made in January  May and September. Changes will be notified in advance via the Linked Data Service mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/lds) and the Integrated Authority File GND Ontology mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/gnd-ontology). Please subscribe if you are interested in receiving information about future developments in DNB Linked Data Services. In a schedule corresponding to the export releases  updated dumps of the authority and bibliographic data in RDF/XML and Turtle will be available for download in February  June and October.  The authors welcome comments on this document  preferably via the public GND ontology list; public archives are available.   The Integrated Authority File  The ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (GND  Integrated Authority File) brings together the content of the former Corporate Body Authority File GKD (Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei)  the Name Authority File PND (Personennamendatei)  the Subject Headings Authority File SWD (Schlagwortnormdatei) and the Uniform Title File of the Deutsches Musikarchiv EST file (Einheitssachtitel-Datei ) to form an integrated authority file.  The target has therefore been reached of setting up an authority file which covers all types of entities and which serves as a common  authoritative reference system for libraries' bibliographic data and for the cataloging data of other authority file users such as archives  museums  projects  scientific and cultural institutions. All library networks in the German-speaking countries and the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) are involved in the GND project alongside the German National Library.  The GND should consign to the past problems arising from different formats  parallel storage of data records and different rules for descriptive and subject cataloging.  The objective of the GND is to form a modern  web-compatible authority file which is capable of networking the wide range of resources and information held by libraries and other cultural institutions in the German-speaking countries and making these accessible to users. To approach a web-compatible authority file we also provide the GND as linked data. Therefore we developed an independent GND specific vocabulary (GND Ontology) that almost completely covers the offered GND concepts provided in MARC 21.",authorities; bibliographic; buildings; concepts; corporations; crossdomain; format-foaf; format-rdf; format-rdfs; format-skos; germany; lld; lod; no-deref-vocab; no-license-metadata; no-provenance-metadata; no-vocab-mappings; persons; places; published-by-producer; rdf,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei,cultural heritage,tangible-movable,DESC,YES,,cultural heritage,

masc,Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) of the Open American National Corpus,The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) consists of approximately 500 000 words of contemporary American English written and spoken data drawn from the OPEN AMERICAN NATIONAL CORPUS (OANC).      All of MASC includes manually validated annotations for sentence boundaries  token  lemma and POS; noun and verb chunks; and named entities (person  location  organization  date). Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus  including full-text annotation for FrameNet frame elements  WordNet sense tags  and Penn Treebank syntactic annotation. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects.      Unlike most freely available corpora including a wide variety of linguistic annotations  MASC contains texts from a broad range of genres.      MASC is an OPEN LANGUAGE DATA resource that can be downloaded by anyone for any purpose. At the same time  it is a resource that will be enhanced by the community  through its contributions of annotations and derived data.    The RDF conversion from GrAF is still in preparation. Below  you can find a preliminary OWL2/DL representation of the PennTreebank syntax (60.000 tok) in OWL  generated out of the original annotations  instead. Triple counts and links refer to this fragment.

taxonconcept,TaxonConcept Knowledge Base,Species are known by many different names. The TaxonConcept Knowledge Base provides informative Linked Open Data URI's for species concepts that improve the quality and stability of links between a species and data about that species. There are currently 108 175 species concepts and a and 1 000 records for species occurrences. There are also a few examples of references  and image galleries. I have added links below for an insect  mammal  bird and tree to serve as examples of the interlinking etc. The occurrence records are interlinked with GeoNames.     A species can have several different classifications  for instance it's classification in NCBI and DBpedia  are different. To allow multiple classifications  the species model is separate from any specific classification. However many want these two aspects connected together. To make this easy  I have created an additional owl:sameAs RDF dump file which makes the #Taxonomy the same as the #Species. This is particularly useful for browsing SPARQL query results with Microsoft Pivot. In addition  it is also possible to create similar mapping files that can be used to   tie the species to alternative classifications.

LusTRE considers the heterogeneity in scopes and levels of abstraction of environmental thesauri as an asset when managing environmental data  it exploits linked data best practices SKOS  (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and RDF  (Resource Description Framework) in order to provide a multi-thesauri solution for INSPIRE data themes related to the environment.   The ThIST content is made available by Geological Survey of Italy in ISPRA  (Istituto Superiore per la  Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale). It is the result of a nearly total revision of the thesaurus born by the integration among the terminological database of the former Library of the Italy Geological Service  and the thesaurus published by the CNR in 1997.
