It was physically located in New York City from 1982-2002 and is now in San Francisco.    The Archives was founded by Rick Prelinger in 1982 in order to preserve what he calls ""ephemeral"" films: films sponsored by corporations and organizations  educational films  and amateur and home movies. Typically  ephemeral films were produced to fulfill specific purposes at specific times  and many exist today only by chance or accident. About 65% of the Archive's holdings are in the public domain because their copyrights have expired  or because they were U.S. productions that were published without proper copyright notice.    This dataset consists of metadata about more than 2 000 public domain films that the Prelinger Archives have made available for unrestricted use via the Internet Archive.    *Note* this dataset is no longer updated  it was taken off-line during the shutdown of Kasabi.

dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei0000018da796a714,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei,Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND),"GND stands for ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (Integrated Authority File) and offers a broad range of elements to describe authorities. The GND originates from the German library community and aims to solve the name ambiguity problem in the library world. Corresponding data is usually expressed in a customized MARC 21 Authority Format (GND MARC Format) which is quite domain specific and is not used beyond the library and publisher world. The GND ontology tries to bridge this gap by providing a format specification for the usage in the semantic web.  The need for name disambiguity and entries having an authoritative character is an issue that concerns a lot more communities than the library world. In a growing information society the unique identification and linking of persons  places and other authorities becomes more and more important. The GND Ontology aims to transfer the made experience from libraries to the web community by providing a vocabulary for the description of differentiated and undifferentiated persons  conferences or events  corporate bodies  places or geographic names  subject headings  and works.  To ensure compatibility aspects the GND ontology aligns a number of already established vocabularies like the FOAF vocabulary.  The GND is a young specification that probably will underlie certain smaller changes. However  the currently defined classes and properties have a status of stability. But we also expect the introduction of additional elements caused by newly upcoming requirements within the community. From January 2014 on  the Linked Data Service of the German National Library (DNB) will issue scheduled releases and will be integrated in the export releases of the other formats. Changes to the conversion and to the data modelling will be made in January  May and September. Changes will be notified in advance via the Linked Data Service mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/lds) and the Integrated Authority File GND Ontology mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/gnd-ontology). Please subscribe if you are interested in receiving information about future developments in DNB Linked Data Services. In a schedule corresponding to the export releases  updated dumps of the authority and bibliographic data in RDF/XML and Turtle will be available for download in February  June and October.  The authors welcome comments on this document  preferably via the public GND ontology list; public archives are available.   The Integrated Authority File  The ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (GND  Integrated Authority File) brings together the content of the former Corporate Body Authority File GKD (Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei)  the Name Authority File PND (Personennamendatei)  the Subject Headings Authority File SWD (Schlagwortnormdatei) and the Uniform Title File of the Deutsches Musikarchiv EST file (Einheitssachtitel-Datei ) to form an integrated authority file.  The target has therefore been reached of setting up an authority file which covers all types of entities and which serves as a common  authoritative reference system for libraries' bibliographic data and for the cataloging data of other authority file users such as archives  museums  projects  scientific and cultural institutions. All library networks in the German-speaking countries and the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) are involved in the GND project alongside the German National Library.  The GND should consign to the past problems arising from different formats  parallel storage of data records and different rules for descriptive and subject cataloging.  The objective of the GND is to form a modern  web-compatible authority file which is capable of networking the wide range of resources and information held by libraries and other cultural institutions in the German-speaking countries and making these accessible to users. To approach a web-compatible authority file we also provide the GND as linked data. Therefore we developed an independent GND specific vocabulary (GND Ontology) that almost completely covers the offered GND concepts provided in MARC 21.",authorities; bibliographic; buildings; concepts; corporations; crossdomain; format-foaf; format-rdf; format-rdfs; format-skos; germany; lld; lod; no-deref-vocab; no-license-metadata; no-provenance-metadata; no-vocab-mappings; persons; places; published-by-producer; rdf; tangible,cultural heritage,cultural heritage,,cultural heritage,,,,,,,,

viaf,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/viaf,VIAF: The Virtual International Authority File,"VIAF (Virtual International Autority File) is an OCLC dataset and service -- built in cooperation with national libraries and other partners -- that virtually combines multiple LAM (Library Archives Museum) name authority files into a single name authority service. Put simply it is a large database of people and organizations that occur in library catalogs.      VIAF is a joint project of 20  national libraries  implemented and hosted by OCLC. The project's goal is to lower the cost and increase the utility of library authority files by matching and linking the authority files of national libraries  and then making that information available on the Web.    ### Openness    The data is released under Open Data Commons Attribution license. Attribution is requested as follows:    > Adherence to ODC Attribution instructions for the correct assertion of attribution is encouraged. The preferred form of attribution for VIAF is:  >  > ""This [title of report or article or dataset] contains information from VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) which is made available under the ODC Attribution License.""  >   > Special cases: In circumstances where providing the full attribution statement above is not technically feasible  the use of canonical VIAF URIs is adequate to satisfy Section 4.3 of the ODC Attribution License.    #### Older information preserved for archival purposes    OCLC is currently in discussion with partners about how to license material. [Message from Thom Hickey  OCLC Chief Scientist](http://groups.google.com/group/nyt_linked_open_data/browse_thread/thread/46ea00276e3d5a2e#) on public Google Groups mailing list in January 2010 states:    > VIAF is a joint project with the contributing institutions and OCLC doesn?t claim any rights to the data beyond what the group has.  Unfortunately the group as a whole has problems coming up with a statement of exactly what is permitted.  In lieu of that  our position is that the data on the site is freely available for use through the APIs  although if someone wants a copy of the whole thing they would have to apply to the VIAF consortium (they could do that through me or Barbara Tillett at LC).  Along those same lines  if someone is going to have substantial activity against VIAF (multiple queries/second) we?d like to know about it ahead of time.     > Over the next few months we will be working on a better statement of what?s permitted  but our intention is to make the data as freely available as possible (even to the NYT).       Further update from Thom Hickey:  (http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2011/03/use-of-viaf.html)    > I responded to a recent blog post on LibraryThing which mentioned restrictions on the use of VIAF and its relationship to the LC authority file.    > In fact  VIAF is open for use by anyone.  Here's what I said about the use of VIAF:    > VIAF is a project led by LC  the French and German national libraries and OCLC. There are no restrictions on its use. Dumps of the complete file are available  but need the approval of the project leaders.    > VIAF is not designed to replace the LC/NACO authority file  but rather is built from it and a number of similar files.    > I hope that is clear.  We really do want people to use VIAF!

Authors  readers  and scholars are now able to discover and share an increasing amount of information about books and their authors. However  these sources of knowledge are fragmented and do not adequately represent non-Western writers and their works. In this paper we present The World Literature Knowledge Graph  a semantic resource containing 194   346 writers and 965  210 works  specifically designed for exploring facts about literary works and authors from different parts of the world. The knowledge graph integrates information about the reception of literary works gathered from 3 different communities of readers  aligned according to a single semantic model. The resource is accessible through an online visualization platform  which can be found at the following URL: https://literaturegraph.di.unito.it/3. This platform has been rigorously tested and validated by 3 distinct categories of experts who have found it to be highly beneficial for their respective work domains. These categories include teachers  researchers in the humanities  and professionals in the publishing industry. The feedback received from these experts confirms that they can effectively utilize the platform to enhance their work processes and achieve valuable outcomes.,tangible,cultural heritage,cultural heritage,,cultural heritage,,,,,,,,

It provides access to the same collection data available through the Museum?s web presented Collection Online  but in a computer readable format. The use of the W3C open data standard  RDF  allows the Museum?s collection data to join and relate to a growing body of linked data published by other organisations around the world interested in promoting accessibility and collaboration.    The data has also been organised using the CIDOC-CRM (Conceptual Reference Model) crucial for harmonising with other cultural heritage data. The current version is beta and development work continues to improve the service. We hope that the service will be used by the community to develop friendly web applications that are freely available to the community.

data-hnm-hu,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/data-hnm-hu,data-hnm-hu - Hungarian National Museum Datasets,"Open linked data from the Hungarian National Museum.   The following datasets and subsets are available:    * Collections (dataset  short  name: colls)   * Bibliographic Data of the Central Library (subset  short name: colls-lib-bib)    The Bibliographic Data of the Central Library contains the entire online catalogue of the library in BIBFRAME format and provides links to external sources including: [BNF](http://data.bnf.fr)  [ISNI](http://isni.org)  [LC NAF](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html)  [VIAF](http:viaf.org) and [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org).    One of the aims of this publication is to make Hungarian librarians more familiar with BIBFRAME. In order to achieve this the BIBFRAME and the MARC descriptions are cross linked. Knowing the BIBFRAME URI of an instance:    [http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563](http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563)    one can get the MARC description by appending "".opac"" to the URI:    [http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac](http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac).    Knowing the permalink of an OPAC record     [http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563)    one can get the BIBRAME description in HTML format by appending .rdf to it:    [http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf).    Other formats can also be invoked by appending the following extensions:  .rdf-ttl  .rdf-nt  .rdf-json  .rdf-jsonld  and .rdf-rdf. The .rdf-rdf extentsion gives back the rdf-xml format.    Clicking the BIBFRAME icon in the OPAC also leads to the BIBFRAME description.    The OPAC pages also support the link rel discovery service in order for the crawlers and other programs to find the RDF descriptions in different formats automatically.    The project was carried out in partnership with @Cult srl.  Italy (MARC BIBFRAME conversion) and Monguz Ltd.  Hungary (OPAC modification). We also used some parts of the ALIADA open source tool.    The @Cult MARC21 BIBFRAME conversion have the following main features:    - Work recognition  - Entity recognition  - Name entities are linked to external datasets.
