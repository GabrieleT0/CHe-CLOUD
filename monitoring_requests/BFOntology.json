      "en": "\nThe Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a small, upper-level ontology that is designed for use in supporting information retrieval, analysis and integration in scientific and other domains. BFO is a genuine upper ontology. Thus it does not contain physical, chemical, biological or other terms which would properly fall within the coverage domains of the special sciences. BFO is used by more than 130 ontology-driven endeavors throughout the world."
