8,SDG0000019242367ae8,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/SDG,A Knowledge Organization System for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,In December 2017  an informal working group led by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the Secretariat of the United Nations High Level Committee on Management  and composed by technical experts from across the UN System  started working on a proposal to developed a system of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for Sustainable Development Goals  Targets  Indicators and related statistical series to support the development of a United Nations system-wide ecosystem of machine-readable data and documents based on Linked Open Data (LOD) principles.  In order to ensure their fullest possible use  the Identifiers and a formal Statement of Adoption were presented at the second regular session of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB)  in November 2019. At the CEB  the Secretary-General invited all UN organizations to use them to map their SDG-related resources and sign the Statement.  Unique Identifiers for the sustainable development goals  targets and indicators  The system of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for Sustainable Development Goals  Targets  Indicators and related statistical series is now part of the Semantic Web infrastructure that the UN Dag Hammarskjold Library makes available to IT developers and the public at large under http://metadata.un.org/sdg/?lang=en.  It formalizes links between the goals  targets  indicators and series  and two other crucial elements in the Linked Open Data infrastructure maintained by the United Nation System  namely: (1) the UN Bibliographic Information System maintained by the UN Dag Hammarskjold Library  and (2) the SDG Interface Ontology  maintained by UN Environment.   The identifiers allow the use of Semantic Web technologies to:  •             Provide a web-based mechanism to make SDG-related data and information assets accessible  inter-operable and re-usable   •             Organically discover relevant and authoritative SDG data and information among the multitude of available sources on the web  •             Enable the development of applications that integrate authoritative data  concepts and definitions from a large number of formerly unknown sources.

1109,model10000018e0765eeca,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/model1,An automatic approach for land-change detection and land updates based on integrated NDVI timing analysis and the CVAPS method with GEE support,Land-use/land-cover information is the basis of global-change research and regional governmental management. Automatic approaches are always required to update land maps for large-scale areas  and change detection techniques are the most important component of land-updating methods. Previous research has confirmed that simple change detection based on Landsat images from two different years with two different phenophases yields unsatisfactory results and may induce many misclassifications and pseudo-change identifications because of the phenological differences between remote sensing images. With the support of the Google Earth Engine (GEE)  we propose a land-use/land-cover type discrimination method based on a classification and regression tree (CART)  apply change-vector analysis in posterior probability space (CVAPS) and the best histogram maximum entropy method for change detection  and further improve the accuracy of the land-updating results in combination with NDVI timing analysis  which indicates the annual growth of ground vegetation. In the case study  we select western China as the research area and obtain a 2014 land map based on the ESA GlobCover 2009 dataset. The results confirm that the accuracy of the land-renewal results based on the CART-CVAPS-NDVI method reach 78.6-88.2%  which is 4-10% higher than that of the CART-CVPAS method without NDVI timing analysis. The CART-CVAPS-NDVI method has more detailed and accurate resolutions for land-change detection.,NDVI; timing analysis,not classified - geography,,,,

264,anno0000018da2d42240,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/anno,ANNO,The Anthropological Notation Ontology (ANNO) allows the systematic and standardized classification of recovered bone finds into the skeletal system  the description of the skeletal pieces  and the definition of functions for the derivation of different phenotypes of humans in forensic and historical anthropology. ANNO consists of two components: ANNOdc  a domain-core ontology providing core entities such as basic anatomical categories  and ANNOds  a domain-specific ontology used for annotating structures of the human skeleton. ANNO is integrated into AnthroWorks3D  a photogrammetry pipeline and application for the creation and analysis of 3D-models of human skeletal remains. The integration is based on the three-ontology method with the General Formal Ontology as the top-level ontology  ANNOdc as the task ontology and ANNOds as the domain ontology. Thus  AnthroWorks3D only needs to implement access to the entities (classes and properties) of the task ontology  whereas the entities of the corresponding domain ontology are imported dynamically. ANNO supports the analysis of skeletal and bone finds in forensic and historical anthropology  facilitating the standardization of data annotation and ensuring accurate preservation of information for posterity.,anthropology,health,antropology from the description,,,

524,asit,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/asit,Atlante Sintattico d'Italia (ASIt),"The Atlante Sintattico d'Italia  Syntactic Atlas of Italy (ASIt) enterprise builds on a long standing tradition of collecting and analysing linguistic corpora  which has originated different efforts and projects over the years. ASIt accounts for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages  thus it does not need a thorough part of speech (POS) disambiguation  since the ""trivial"" identification of basic POS (e.g. Nouns vs Verbs) is not enough to capture cross-linguistic differences between closely related languages. Secondly  the linguistic variants cannot be reduced to lexical distinctions only  i.e. syntactic differences are in general unpredictable on the basis of the properties of single lexical items. A specific tag set designed to capture sentence-level phenomena without taking into consideration POS tags is needed. As a consequence  while other tag sets are designed to carry out a gross linguistic analysis of a vast corpus  the ASIt tag set aims to capture fine-grained grammatical differences by comparing various dialectal translations of the same sentence. Moreover  in order to pin down these subtle asymmetries  the linguistic analysis must be carried out manually.    To explain why the needs for ASIt are so special we have to take into consideration two different aspects: the nature of Italian dialects  and the kind of linguistic theory ASIt aims to interact with. The Italian dialectal area presents a kind of variation that involves parametric choices affecting many general aspects of syntax  morphology  and phonology. The kind of information we want to gather involves not only the presence of a certain element  but also the absence of an element; an element can be omitted only in some constructions and in conjunction with specific characteristics of the language. For this reason  ASIt proposed the creation of a specific set of tags starting from a universal core shared by all languages (on the basis of the work done by DynaSAND)  and subsequently developing a language-specific periphery which is compatible with other projects.    Dialectal data stored in the ASIt were gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. These data and information were collected by means of questionnaires formed by sets of Italian sentences: dialectal speakers were asked to translate them into their dialects and write their translations in the questionnaire; therefore  each questionnaire is associated with many parallel dialectal translations. At present  there are eight different questionnaires written in Italian and almost 500 questionnaires  corresponding to the eight Italian questionnaires  written in more than 240 different dialects  for a total of more than 54 000 sentences and more than 40 000 tags stored in the data resource managed by the ASIt digital library system.",Italian; corpus; dialect; linguistics; llod; lod; questionnaire; syntax,linguistic,from the description,,,

317,bioportal-bao,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/bioportal-bao,BioAssay Ontology,The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) describes chemical biology screening assays and their results including high-throughput screening (HTS) data for the purpose of categorizing assays and data analysis.  BAO is an extensible  knowledge-based  highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening  including Perturbagen  Format  Meta Target  Design   Detection Technology  and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex)  or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical  cell-based  organism-based  and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.  Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50  percent inhibition  etc.).  BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays.  All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes  which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,health,bio in the title. confirmed by the description,,,

Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and electoral studies,**dati.camera.it - Linked Open Data della Camera dei deputati**    **The BPR - Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali**  (Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies) is a database of bibliographic references of books and articles in periodical journals addressing the history of the Italian Parliament and the history of elections. In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:      * the Italian Parliament  from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848  the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;  * elections (laws  procedures  results)  with reference to general elections as from 1848.      The BPR addresses primarily studies in law  plus studies in political science  organisational science  political sociology  as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.    Each bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes  which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.    The BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers  it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs  judgements  articles from periodicals  contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.,bibliographic data; bibliography; country-italy; library; lod; lodcloud-diagram-2014-08-30; lodlam; rdf; rdf-format,not classified - government,,,,

The catalogue that powers the Bricklink website is available for download and reuse and has been used to create this dataset.    Currently the dataset consists of descriptions of over 9000 Lego sets and over 23 000 Lego parts. A number of the lego sets have detailed inventories including number  type and colour of parts. There are also links to sets  instructions and part images.    *Note* this dataset is no longer updated  it was taken off-line during the shutdown of Kasabi.

The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop  we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy  bio-molecules  chemicals and drugs  pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC  DSMZ  ECACC  ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,health,"cell cited in the title

A common design pattern for the cell line is used to model cell lines and their attributes  the Jurkat cell line provides ane xample.  Currently CLO contains over 36 000 cell line entries obtained from ATCC  HyperCLDB  Coriell  and bymanual curation.

Cooperation is choosing to do a behavior that is best for the collective. CoDa contains six decades of studies on individual decision making in dyads and groups facing social dilemmas.The databank contains studies on human cooperation published in Chinese  English  and Japanese. Experts annotated these studies for 275 variables  including the quantitative results (effect sizes). We developed an ontology that defines and relates concepts in cooperation research and that can represent the relationships between individual study results. We have created an application that allows users to search the databank  and enables users to retrieve studies that test the relation of variables with cooperation  visualize these study results  and perform (1) meta-analyses  (2) meta-regressions  (3) estimates of publication bias  and (4) statistical power analyses for future studies.,Psychology; Sociology; Economics; Cooperation research; Prisoner's dilemma; Public Goods Game; Resource Dilemma; social dilemmas,not classified,,,,

The ""Authority code"" relays on the ISO 3166-1/alpha-3 positions. If the ISO code doesn't exist  an alpha-numeric code is created. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are also offered as from 1950 till now with the date(s) of event(s).

Codes marked in italic are obsolete and should not be used  excepted in the case of back-log work.  ISO 3166 is the International standard for country codes. The purpose of ISO 3166 is to establish codes for the representation of names of countries. This standard exists in three forms:      ISO 3166-1 (2006) contains a two-letter code which is recommended as the general purpose code  a three-letter code which has better mnenomic properties and a numeric-3 code which can be useful if script independence of the codes is important.     ISO 3166-2 (2007) gives codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. This code is based on the two-letter code element from ISO 3166-1 followed by a separator and a further string of up to three alphanumeric characters.     ISO 3166-3 (1999) contains a four-letter code for those country names which have been deleted from ISO 3166-1 since its first publication in 1974. The code elements for formerly used country names have a length of four alphabetical characters (alpha-4 code elements).  The ISO 3166-1 is also used by the EU Geonomenclature of the Statistical Office  the UN/LOCODE  the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  the Internet Assigned Authority Numbers (IANA) and more other organisations.",controlled vocabulary; country; countries; geography,not classified - geography,from title-abstract-keywords,,,

The following datasets and subsets are available:    * Collections (dataset  short  name: colls)   * Bibliographic Data of the Central Library (subset  short name: colls-lib-bib)    The Bibliographic Data of the Central Library contains the entire online catalogue of the library in BIBFRAME format and provides links to external sources including: [BNF](http://data.bnf.fr)  [ISNI](http://isni.org)  [LC NAF](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html)  [VIAF](http:viaf.org) and [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org).    One of the aims of this publication is to make Hungarian librarians more familiar with BIBFRAME. In order to achieve this the BIBFRAME and the MARC descriptions are cross linked. Knowing the BIBFRAME URI of an instance:    [http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563](http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563)    one can get the MARC description by appending "".opac"" to the URI:    [http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac](http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac).    Knowing the permalink of an OPAC record     [http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563)    one can get the BIBRAME description in HTML format by appending .rdf to it:    [http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf).    Other formats can also be invoked by appending the following extensions:  .rdf-ttl  .rdf-nt  .rdf-json  .rdf-jsonld  and .rdf-rdf. The .rdf-rdf extentsion gives back the rdf-xml format.    Clicking the BIBFRAME icon in the OPAC also leads to the BIBFRAME description.    The OPAC pages also support the link rel discovery service in order for the crawlers and other programs to find the RDF descriptions in different formats automatically.    The project was carried out in partnership with @Cult srl.  Italy (MARC BIBFRAME conversion) and Monguz Ltd.  Hungary (OPAC modification). We also used some parts of the ALIADA open source tool.    The @Cult MARC21 BIBFRAME conversion have the following main features:    - Work recognition  - Entity recognition  - Name entities are linked to external datasets.

DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data.    The English version of the DBpedia knowledge base currently describes 6.0M entities of which 4.6M have abstracts  1.53M have geo coordinates and 1.6M depictions. In total  5.2M resources are classified in a consistent ontology  consisting of 1.5M persons  810K places (including 505K populated places)  490K works (including 135K music albums  106K films and 20K video games)  275K organizations (including 67K companies and 53K educational institutions)  301K species and 5K diseases. The total number of resources in English DBpedia is 16.9M that  besides the 6.0M resources  includes 1.7M skos concepts (categories)  7.3M redirect pages  260K disambiguation pages and 1.7M intermediate nodes.     Altogether the DBpedia 2016-04 release consists of 9.5 billion (2015-10: 8.8 billion) pieces of information (RDF triples) out of which 1.3 billion (2015-10: 1.1 billion) were extracted from the English edition of Wikipedia  5.0 billion (2015-04: 4.4 billion) were extracted from other language editions and 3.2 billion (2015-10: 3.2 billion) from DBpedia Commons and Wikidata.

701,dbpedia-abstract-corpus,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/dbpedia-abstract-corpus,DBpedia abstract corpus,This corpus contains a conversion of Wikipedia abstracts in six languages (dutch  english  french  german  italian and spanish) into the I used the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). The corpus contains the abstract texts  as well as the position  surface form and linked article of all links in the text. As such  it contains entity mentions manually disambiguated to Wikipedia/DBpedia resources by native speakers  which predestines it for NER training and evaluation.    Furthermore  the abstracts represent a special form of text that lends itself to be used for more sophisticated tasks  like open relation extraction. Their encyclopedic style  following Wikipedia guidelines on opening paragraphs adds further interesting properties. The first sentence puts the article in broader context. Most anaphers will refer to the original topic of the text  making them easier to resolve. Finally  should the same string occur in different meanings  Wikipedia guidelines suggest that the new meaning should again be linked for disambiguation. In short: The type of text is highly interesting.

Plant photo data is the data generated in the process of collecting plant digital images by digital cameras or scanners for wild or cultivated plant groups  including plant images  identification species information  shooting time  location  habitat and other data. Plant image is the most direct way to understand plant characters  and it is also an important material for plant taxonomy and related research. Plant images can not only be used as research data in scientific research  scientific popularization  species identification and other fields  but also the time  location  habitat and other information recorded during shooting or collection can be used as important observation data to effectively supplement the shortcomings of traditional species information collection methods such as plant specimen collection in timeliness and completeness. In addition  the plant image of classification and identification can also be used as the basic data of computer vision technology research for the development of plant image intelligent recognition system and other rapid identification technology.

77,framebase-schema,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/framebase-schema,FrameBase schema,FrameBase is a linked open knowledge base meant to *uniformly represent a wide range of knowledge*  tackling semantic heterogeneity among various sources of structured knowledge  such as the ones in the Linked Open Data cloud. It provides a flexible and uniform way of capturing n-ary relationships by adapting and combining repositories of frames from the fields of linguistics and cognitive science (FrameNet and WordNet) to establish a large and wide-coverage vocabulary that can be used to represent complex knowledge and extended with more specific elements.    There are two interconnected representation levels in FrameBase:    * A highly expressive layer where information is represented with explicit entities instantiating the frames  and representing specific situations  processes or events of any kind  organized into a rich hierarchy.    * A less expressive but simpler layer based on direct binary predicates between the elements (participants  properties) of the frames. This level is more compact to store and query  and it is connected with the other layer by means Reification-Dereification (ReDer) rules. It can also be used to connect to similar predicates in other sources of structured knowledge or natural language.    FrameBase is distributed in RDF (Resource Description Format)  though it can be translated to other formats.    FrameBase connects to other knowledge bases by means of integration rules that can link data in ways that cannot be implemented with existing binary properties like owl:sameAs and rdfs:subClassOf .    Furthermore  because of FrameNet's ties to linguistic semantics  it offers additional possibilities for interfacing with natural language  both for querying and text mining.,data heterogeneity; data mining; graph databases; knowledge bases; linguistics; linked data; rdf; semantic web,linguistic,by the abstract,,,

1518,dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei0000018da796a714,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei,Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND),"GND stands for ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (Integrated Authority File) and offers a broad range of elements to describe authorities. The GND originates from the German library community and aims to solve the name ambiguity problem in the library world. Corresponding data is usually expressed in a customized MARC 21 Authority Format (GND MARC Format) which is quite domain specific and is not used beyond the library and publisher world. The GND ontology tries to bridge this gap by providing a format specification for the usage in the semantic web.  The need for name disambiguity and entries having an authoritative character is an issue that concerns a lot more communities than the library world. In a growing information society the unique identification and linking of persons  places and other authorities becomes more and more important. The GND Ontology aims to transfer the made experience from libraries to the web community by providing a vocabulary for the description of differentiated and undifferentiated persons  conferences or events  corporate bodies  places or geographic names  subject headings  and works.  To ensure compatibility aspects the GND ontology aligns a number of already established vocabularies like the FOAF vocabulary.  The GND is a young specification that probably will underlie certain smaller changes. However  the currently defined classes and properties have a status of stability. But we also expect the introduction of additional elements caused by newly upcoming requirements within the community. From January 2014 on  the Linked Data Service of the German National Library (DNB) will issue scheduled releases and will be integrated in the export releases of the other formats. Changes to the conversion and to the data modelling will be made in January  May and September. Changes will be notified in advance via the Linked Data Service mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/lds) and the Integrated Authority File GND Ontology mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/gnd-ontology). Please subscribe if you are interested in receiving information about future developments in DNB Linked Data Services. In a schedule corresponding to the export releases  updated dumps of the authority and bibliographic data in RDF/XML and Turtle will be available for download in February  June and October.  The authors welcome comments on this document  preferably via the public GND ontology list; public archives are available.   The Integrated Authority File  The ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (GND  Integrated Authority File) brings together the content of the former Corporate Body Authority File GKD (Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei)  the Name Authority File PND (Personennamendatei)  the Subject Headings Authority File SWD (Schlagwortnormdatei) and the Uniform Title File of the Deutsches Musikarchiv EST file (Einheitssachtitel-Datei ) to form an integrated authority file.  The target has therefore been reached of setting up an authority file which covers all types of entities and which serves as a common  authoritative reference system for libraries' bibliographic data and for the cataloging data of other authority file users such as archives  museums  projects  scientific and cultural institutions. All library networks in the German-speaking countries and the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) are involved in the GND project alongside the German National Library.  The GND should consign to the past problems arising from different formats  parallel storage of data records and different rules for descriptive and subject cataloging.  The objective of the GND is to form a modern  web-compatible authority file which is capable of networking the wide range of resources and information held by libraries and other cultural institutions in the German-speaking countries and making these accessible to users. To approach a web-compatible authority file we also provide the GND as linked data. Therefore we developed an independent GND specific vocabulary (GND Ontology) that almost completely covers the offered GND concepts provided in MARC 21.",authorities; bibliographic; buildings; concepts; corporations; crossdomain; format-foaf; format-rdf; format-rdfs; format-skos; germany; lld; lod; no-deref-vocab; no-license-metadata; no-provenance-metadata; no-vocab-mappings; persons; places; published-by-producer; rdf,,,,,

GRO is intended to represent common knowledge about gene regulation in a formal way rather than representing extremely fine-grained classes as can be found in ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (created for data base annotation purposes) and various relevant databases. The main purpose of the ontology is to support NLP applications. It has a particular focus on the relations between processes and the molecules (participants) involved. The basic structure of the GRO is a direct acyclic graph (DAG) with ontology classes as nodes and is-a relations between classes as edges. The taxonomic backbone is further enriched by several semantic relation types (part-of  from-species  participates-in with the two sub-relations agent-of and patient-of).,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,health,gene in title and abstract,,,

GACS Core is the first of potentially many concept schemes in this larger concept space. The idea for GACS emerged out of discussions at the World Congress of IAALD  the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists  in July 2013. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  CAB International (CABI)  and the National Agricultural Library of the USA (NAL) agreed in October 2013 to explore the feasibility of developing a shared concept scheme by integrating their three thesauri: the AGROVOC Concept Scheme  the CAB Thesaurus (CABT)  and NAL Thesaurus (NALT). In the GACS vision  the integration of these three thesauri is but the first step towards the realization of a hub that links to and from the concept schemes beyond the initial three  and in multiple language areas.,format-skos; biology; ecology; organisms; agriculture; earth sciences; health; forestry; fishery; environment; nutrition,not classified,I wonder why biology is among keywords,,yes,
346,global-hunger-index-2011,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/global-hunger-index-2011,Global Hunger Index (2011),The Global Hunger Index (GHI) offers a useful multidimensional overview of global hunger. The 2011 GHI is the sixth in an annual series that records the state of global  regional  and national hunger.    The GHI captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of calories  shortfalls in the nutritional status of children  and child mortality. Accordingly  the Index includes the following three equally weighted indicators: the proportion of people who are undernourished  as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the prevalence of underweight in children under the age of five  as compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO); and the under-five mortality rate  as reported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The 2011 index includes GHI values for four time periods  recalculated using the latest source data  to allow an exploration of change over time.,crossdomain; development; food; format-qb; hunger; license-metadata; lod; lodcloud; no-proprietary-vocab; published-by-producer,not classified,,,,

For more information see: http://iati2lod.appspot.com    It is widely recognized that the effectiveness of aid can be improved by providing transparant insight into aid activities. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)  a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to improve the transparency of aid  has developed an open standard for the publication of aid information. As of 2013  over 150 donors  NGOs and governments have registered to the IATI registry for publishing their aid activities in this XML standard. Based on the IATI data  we have created a Linked Data model and converted the open data to Linked Data. In order to show the added benefits of Linked Data  we have linked the IATI dataset to various other datasets such as World Bank indicators and DBPedia information. Finally  we have created several applications which combine the information from the IATI dataset and the datasets it was linked to. As a result  we have shown that creating Linked Data for the IATI dataset and linking it to other datasets give new valuable insights in aid transparency. Based on actual information needs and use cases of IATI users  we were able to show that linking IATI data adds significant value to the data and is able to fulfill the needs of IATI users.,Aid; Development; Transparency; accountibility; developing countries; government; ict4d; international-development; ld4d; linked data; lod; lodcloud-diagram-2014-08-30,not classified - government,,,,

It provides a semantic specification of the terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and manages the related knowledge  thus allowing the standardization for immunogenetics data from genome  proteome  genetics  two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures.  IMGT-ONTOLOGY manages the knowledge through diverse facets relying on seven axioms  ""IDENTIFICATION""  ""CLASSIFICATION""  ""DESCRIPTION""  ""NUMEROTATION""  ""LOCALIZATION""  ""ORIENTATION"" and ""OBTENTION"". These axioms postulate that any object  any process and any relation can be identified  classified  described  numbered  localized and orientated  and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY  also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches  the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies  which need to identify  to classify  to describe  to number  to localize and to orientate objects  processes and relations at the molecule  cell  tissue  organ  organism or population levels.

1358,iptc-newscodes,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/iptc-newscodes,IPTC NewsCodes,The IPTC not only provides news exchange formats to the news industry but also creates and maintains sets of concepts to be assigned as metadata values to news objects like text  photographs  graphics  audio- and video files and streams. This allows for a consistent coding of news metadata over the course of time - that's the reason why we call them IPTC NewsCodes.  The universe of NewsCodes is currently split into many different sets - taxonomies - for increased manageability as topics usually relate to a specific area. A taxonomy is also likely to be used exclusively in a specific metadata property of a news exchange format.  To provide an easy overview of our taxonomies further we grouped them into four main areas:  * Descriptive NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies to describe the content of news items  including the key subject classification  IPTC Media Topics (which takes over from the previous IPTC Subject Codes). * Administrative NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies for proper administration of news items. * Transmission NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies with controlled values for the transmission process. * Exchange Format NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies with values to support specific functionalities of the different IPTC news exchange format standards. NewsML 1.x  NewsML-G2  EventsML-G2 and SportsML-G2 make use of this feature.   Each NewsCodes vocabulary can be referenced via our site  downloaded as a NewsML-G2 Knowledge Item  or downloaded in SKOS format (with IKOS extensions) in RDF/XML   RDF/Turtle and JSON-LD.  Find more details about our taxonomies on the [Overview page](https://iptc.org/standards/newscodes/).  Any NewsCode provided by the IPTC can be used at any stage of a news workflow without any royalty fee.

According to this model  each data category is assigned a unique administrative identifier  together with information on the status or decision-making process associated with the data category. In addition  data category specifications in the DCR contain linguistic descriptions  such as data category definitions  statements of associated value domains  and examples. Data category specifications can be associated with a variety of data element names and with language-specific versions of definitions  names  value domains and other attributes.

1590,isocat-metadata,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/isocat-metadata,ISOcat-metadata,The linguistics community is building a metadata-based infrastructure for the description of its research data and tools. At its core is the ISOcat registry ISOcat.org  a collaborative platform to hold a (to be standardized) set of data catgories (i.e.  field descriptors). Descriptors have definitions in natural language and little explicit interrelations. With the registry growing to many hundred entries  authored by many  it is becoming increasingly apparent that the rather informal definitions and their glossary-like design make it hard for users to grasp  exploit and manage the registry’s content. Here we take a large subset of the ISOcat term set and reconstruct from it a tree structure following the footsteps of schema.org. Our ontological re-engineering yields a representation that gives users a hierarchical view of linguistic  metadata-related terminology. The new representation adds to the precision of all definitions by making explicit information which is only implicitly given in the ISOcat registry. It also helps uncovering and addressing potential inconsistencies in term definitions as well as gaps and redundancies in the overall ISOcat term set. The new representation can serve as a complement to the existing ISOcat model  providing additional support for authors and users in browsing  (re-)using  maintaining  and further extending the community’s terminological metadata repertoire.    The set of data categories has been taken from the TDG Metadata of the ISOcat data category registry. As the ISOcat registry changes over time  we give a snapshot of all data in this RDF representation  as generated automatically from the registry's export functionality in Dec 2011. Note that this data is a flat representation of the TDG Metadata entries. Each entry is only represented in RDF with its mnemonic identifier  name  persistent identifier and natural language definition.

1397,jrc-names-ec,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/jrc-names-ec,JRC-Names,JRC-Names is a highly multilingual named entity resource for person and organisation names developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). JRC-Names consists of large lists of names and their many spelling variants (up to hundreds for a single person)  including across scripts (Latin  Greek  Arabic  Cyrillic  Japanese  Chinese  etc.).    The resource is the by-product of the [Europe Media Monitor](http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html) (EMM)) family of applications  which has been analysing up to 220 000 news reports per day  since 2004. EMM recognises names mentioned in the news in over twenty languages and decides automatically for each newly found name whether it belongs to a new entity or whether it is a spelling variant of a previously known entity. This resource allows EMM users to display news about people or organisations even if their names are spelt differently or if the news articles are written in different languages and scripts.    The new linked data edition  accessible through the European Union’s [Open Data Portal](https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/jrc-names)  offers more information compared to the previously released resource and tool  including: titles and function names that have been historically found next to the person mentions; information about the time period during which name variants and their titles were found; various frequency counts; as well as links to other linked datasets such as DBPedia.    The JRC-Names RDF representation is based on [lemon](http://lemon-model.net/) (Lexicon Model for Ontologies) and includes links towards [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/)  [New York Times Open Data](http://data.nytimes.com/) and [Talk of Europe](http://linkedpolitics.ops.few.vu.nl).

It specifies how to transform adjectives in natural language questions to SPARQL query patterns over knowledge bases (currently we focus on DBpedia-202105). For example  the adjective “Chinese” in “Chinese artists” is represented as “?x dbo:nationality dbr:China”  taking the meaning that a Chinese artist should have a fact about his/her nationality with value dbr:China. The adjective “tall” in “tall people” is represented as “?x dbo:height ?y . filter (?y>V)”  taking the meaning that a tall person should have a large value of dbo:height.  Currently  Lark contains about 22.4K SPARQL query patterns for 2.7K adjectives over DBpedia  in Ontolex-lemon (https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) format. All representations have been manually checked before publication. Besides  an online interface for searching adjective representations in Lark is available at http://ws.nju.edu.cn/lark/interface/ .

807,lingvoj,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/lingvoj,lingvoj ? Languages of the World (Multilingual RDF Descriptions),### Description    Lingvoj means languages in Esperanto. From the frontpage of <http://www.lingvoj.org/>:    Since the launch of lingvoj.org in 2007  the linked data cloud has grown at a steady pace  and a growing number of URI sets have been published to identify human languages.  Lexvo.org   is providing the most exhaustive of those so far  in which URIs for languages are integrated in a global approach of terminology. Through exchanges with Gerard de Melo  editor at Lexvo.org  it has been decided to redirect and deprecate lingvoj.org URIs for individual languages to the benefit of the more stable and exhaustive publication at Lexvo.org.    Most lingvoj.org URIs for individual languages are redirected to lexvo.org URIs through content negotiation. A few exceptions are URIs of languages with no ISO 639-3 codes  since lexvo URIs are built on those codes  and languages with a regional tag  such as en-us.     The  lingvoj-to-lexvo RDF file provides the mappings and equivalence between lingvo and lexvo URIs. Applications using the lingvoj.org URIs are invited to change their references accordingly  although the redirection mechanism should avoid any breakdown of applications using lingvoj.org URIs.     ### Openness: OPEN      * License: not specified but Open Data logo prominently displayed and part of the Linked Data effort so assumed to be open.    * Access: Good.      * bulk.

Currently  only data from the product labels of prescription drugs and a subset of over the counter medications is provided. A powerful feature of LinkedSPLs is that all active moieties and product labels are mapped to RxNORM PURLs provided by the NCBO Bioportal SPARQL endpoint. Also  this site's SPL data is updated weekly and all SPLs retain DailyMed versioning data so that researchers can record the provenance of the text and sections they work with. LinkedSPLs is provided as a service as part of the Drug Interaction Knowledge Base (DIKB) project.    NOTE: This resource shows content present in the Structured Product Labels provided by the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) DailyMed resource.

Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus  including full-text annotation for FrameNet frame elements  WordNet sense tags  and Penn Treebank syntactic annotation. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects.      Unlike most freely available corpora including a wide variety of linguistic annotations  MASC contains texts from a broad range of genres.      MASC is an OPEN LANGUAGE DATA resource that can be downloaded by anyone for any purpose. At the same time  it is a resource that will be enhanced by the community  through its contributions of annotations and derived data.    The RDF conversion from GrAF is still in preparation.

1457,EO_metadata,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/EO_metadata,Micka (EO metadata) @PSNC,EO metadata collected from the public Lesproject Micka registry (https://micka.lesprojekt.cz/en/)  which includes information of over 100K geospatial datasets. Micka is a software for spatial data / services metadata management according to ISO  OGC and INSPIRE standards. It allows to retrieve the metadata in RDF forms using Geo-DCAT (an extension of DCAT) for the representation of geographic metadata compliant with the DCAT application profile for European data portals. As such metadata cannot be queried as Linked Data therefore the goal was to make it available in the form of Linked Data in order to enable its integration with other datasets  e.g.  Open Land Use (OLU). The process for publication was straightforward: a dump of all the metadata in RDF format was generated from Micka  which was then loaded into the Virtuoso triplestore. Some exemplary SPARQL queries were then generated to identify connection points for integration  e.g.  get OLU entries and their metadata given a municipal code and type of area (e.g.  agricultural lands).,geospatial; EO; metadata,not classified - geography,,,,

13,mlsa,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/mlsa,MLSA - A Multi-layered Reference Corpus for German Sentiment Analysis,"Sentence-layer annotation represents the most coarse-grained annotation in this  corpus. We adhere to definitions of objectivity and subjectivity introduced in  (Wiebe et al.  2005). Additionally  we followed guidelines drawn from (Balahur &  Steinberger  2009). Their clarifications proved to be quite effective  raising  inter-annotator agreement in a sentence-layer polarity annotation task from  about 50% to >80%. All sentences were annotated in two dimensions.    The first dimension covers the factual nature of the sentence  i.e. whether it  provides objective information or if it is intended to express an opinion   belief or subjective argument. Therefore  it is either objective or subjective.  The second dimension covers the semantic orientation of the sentence  i.e. its  polarity. Thus  it is either positive  negative or neutral.    In the second layer  we model the contextually interpreted sentiments on the  levels of words and NP/PP phrases. That is  the annotation decisions  are based on the meaning of the words in the context of the sentence.    Word sentiment markers:  The sentiments on the level of individual words are expressed by  single character markers added at the end of the words.    A word might be positive (+)  negative(-)  neutral(empty)  a shifter  (~)  an intensifier (^)  or a diminisher (%).    If a word ends with a hyphen (e.g.  ""auf beziehungs-_ bzw.  partnerschaftliche Probleme-""  an underscore is added to the word in  order to prevent missinterpretations of the hyphen as a negative  marker.    Currently  only words that are part of an NP/PP are marked with  sentiment markers. Annotated words are nouns  adjectives  negation  particles  prepositions  adverbs.    The world level annotation was done by 3 persons individually. The  individual results were harmonized into a single reference annotation.      Phrase level markers:    Each phrase is marked up textually by brackets  e.g. ""[auf  beziehungs-_ bzw. partnerschaftliche Probleme-]"". The type of a phrase  (NP/PP) is not written to the brackets. We follow largely the  annotation model of TIGER for structuring embedded NPs and PPs.    Currently  the following limitations with regard to TIGER exist: (1)  Adjectival phrases are not marked up (2) Relative or infinitival  sentences are not included in NPs/PPs if they appear at the end of a  phrase or if the are discontiguous. We do not only annotate the  phrases which immediately contain words that are marked up as polar.  Any dependent subphrase (NP/PP) is integrated into all its dominating  NPs/PPs  e.g. ""[Die tieferen Ursachen [der Faszination+]]"". Dependent  subphrases without any polar words are also included  however  there  is no internal bracketing for them  e.g. ""[hohe+ Ansprüche an Qualität  und Lage]""    At the level of phrases  we distinguish the following markers:  positive (+)  negative (-)  neutral(0)  bipolar (#). The category  'bipolar' is used mainly for coordinations where negative and positive  sentiments of something are kept in balance by the writer. This is  quite common for a lot of binomial constructions as ""Krieg und  Frieden"".",crossdomain; linguistics; lod; sentiment,linguistic,,,,

It offers a unified search form to national legislation databases  a multilingual dictionary (EUROVOC) as well as a context-sensitive help. The project started with 4 national databases and has grown to 23 databases today.  Besides the unified search form (which is not very useful for extraction purposes)  the website also contains links to the respective national websites of the databases. All national databases offer a non-standardized access to their data  which in all cases is HTML or worse (e.g. PDF documents). Given the fact  that there are also no dumps of raw data (e.g. CSV) available  there is no unified N-LEX dataset that can be converted and published as Linked Data. Rather each countries legislation database has to be treated as an autonomous dataset. Thus we have chosen one country  namely Germany and converted this database into Linked Data via scraping.,government; latc; legal; lod,not classified - government,,,,

The Wiki version of the NIF encodes classes as ""categories""  as in the standard Wikipedia. These class categories themselves have editable pages. This therefore allows anyone to update the definitions of the classes.    This Wiki also allows other ""instance"" articles to be tagged with those classes. Properties between classes or between ""instance"" articles can be defined as well. This allows individual terms within ""instance"" articles to be tagged with these properties. There are a few examples of this below.

It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).  It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed  as a proposal to the OBO Foundry.  This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity  and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning.  The BIRNLex biomaterial entities have already been factored to separately maintained ontology - BIRNLexBiomaterialEntity.owl which this BIRNLex-Main.owl file imports.  The Ontology of Biomedical Investigation (OBI) is also imported and forms the foundation for the formal description of all experiment-related artifacts.

790,parole-simple-lexinfo-ontology-lexicons,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/parole-simple-lexinfo-ontology-lexicons,Parole/Simple 'lexinfo' Ontology & lexicons,The Parole/Simple 'lemon' Ontology is the OWL version of the Parole/Simple model (defined during the PAROLE LE2-4017 and SIMPLE LE4-8346 projects) once mapped to the lemon model.    The goal of SIMPLE project was to add semantic information  selected for its relevance for LE applications  to the set of harmonised multifunctional lexica built for 12 European languages by the PAROLE consortium. PAROLE +SIMPLE lexicons   contain morphological  syntactic and semantic information  organised according to a common model and to common linguistic specifications.     The original Parole/Simple model expressed in the parole DTD has been mapped into the lemon model (http://lemon-model.net/lemon#).   Thus the resulting Parole/Simple Ontology imports the Lexinfo+lemon Ontology and adds 'parole elements' (classes and/or properties)  whenever these cannot be mapped to any 'lexinfo element'.     The Spanish lexicon includes 7572 entries fully annotated with syntactic and semantic information.    The Catalan lexicon includes 20545 entries annotated with syntactic information half of which are also annotated with semantic information. The latest version of the Catalan lexicon includes links to the Catalan EuroWordNet lemon lexicon (http://lod.iula.upf.edu/resources/WordNetLemonCAT).    These resources were developed with the support of METANET4U: Enhancing the European Linguistic Infrastructure  (2011-2013)  funded by UNER - Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Program  (CIP-PSP-270893).

138,bioportal-pw,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/bioportal-pw,Pathway ontology,The goal of the Pathway Ontology is to capture the various kinds of biological networks  the relationships between them and the alterations or malfunctioning of such networks within a hierarchical structure. The five nodes are: classic metabolic pathways  regulatory pathways  signaling pathways  drug pathways and disease pathways for complex human conditions. KEGG and Reactome databases  as well as extensive literature searches have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. A complex human disease pathway is viewed in the context of genetic and environmental attributes that can affect or impair the functioning of various molecular and cellular pathways; their combined  accumulated effect is manifested in the diseased phenotype. In many cases the identity of the malfunctioning dynamic entity is speculated rather than known. Metabolic  regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway  if known. The ontology provides a unified way to annotate gene products to any type of pathway as well as to deviant pathways. Its hierarchical structure offers the researcher a 'view' of the connections  if not the dependencies between individual pathways  of the possible link between alterations within these complex biological circuitries and diseases.,biomedicine; bioportal; format-obo; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,health,,,,

1513,reuters-128-nif-ner-corpus,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/reuters-128-nif-ner-corpus,Reuters-128 NIF NER Corpus,This English corpus is based on the well known Reuters-21578 corpus which contains economic news articles. In particular  we chose 128 articles containing at least one NE. Compared to the News-100 corpus the documents of Reuters-128 are significantly shorter and thus carry a smaller context.    To create the annotation of NEs with URIs  we implemented a supporting judgement tool.  .  The input for the tool was a subset of more than 150 Reuters-21578 news articles sampled randomly. First  FOX (Ngonga Ngomo et al.  2011) was used for recognizing a first set of NEs. This reduced the amount of work to a feasible portion regarding the size of this dataset. Afterwards  the domain experts corrected the mistakes of FOX manually using the annotation tool. Therefore  the tool highlighted the entities in the texts and added initial URI candidates via simple string matching algorithms. Two scientists determined the correct URI for each named entity manually with an initial voter agreement of 74%. This low  initial agreement rate hints towards the difficulty of the disambiguation task.  In some cases judges did not agree initially  but came to an agreement shortly after reviewing the cases. While annotating  we left out ticker symbols of companies (e.g.  GOOG for Google Inc.)  abbreviations and job descriptions be-  cause those are always preceded by the full company name respectively a person’s name.,corpus; evaluation; linguistic; linguistics; lod; ner; nif; rdf; training,linguistic,,,,

Despite its name  SNP-Ontology  is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it  (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation  and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,health,,,,

SO-Pharm enables to represent pharmacogenomic relationships between a drug  a genomic variation and a phenotype trait. In addition  it enables to represent patient and more largely panel included in trials  and populations. SO-Pharm enables the representation of measured items on this patients such as results from the observation of a phenotype trait or of genomic variations. SO-Pharm supports knowledge about pharmacogenomic hypothesis  case study  and investigations in pharmacogenomics. SO-Pharm is designed to facilitate data integration and knowledge discovery in pharmacogenomics.

The TaxonConcept Knowledge Base provides informative Linked Open Data URI's for species concepts that improve the quality and stability of links between a species and data about that species. There are currently 108 175 species concepts and a and 1 000 records for species occurrences. There are also a few examples of references  and image galleries. I have added links below for an insect  mammal  bird and tree to serve as examples of the interlinking etc. The occurrence records are interlinked with GeoNames.     A species can have several different classifications  for instance it's classification in NCBI and DBpedia  are different. To allow multiple classifications  the species model is separate from any specific classification. However many want these two aspects connected together. To make this easy  I have created an additional owl:sameAs RDF dump file which makes the #Taxonomy the same as the #Species. This is particularly useful for browsing SPARQL query results with Microsoft Pivot. In addition  it is also possible to create similar mapping files that can be used to   tie the species to alternative classifications.

As such  the RDF graph that fuels this endpoint is structured according the S3DB Core Model entities: Collections  Items  Rules and Statements. The advantage of this annotation is that entities that belong to the description of the domain are annotated as ""Collections"" (for example  ""Sample"" is a Collection) or Rules (for example  ""GenomicCharacterization-obtainedFrom-Sample"" is a Rule) and their instances are annotated as Items (for example  ""TCGA-01-0001"" is an Item of the collection ""Samples) or Statements (for example  ""TCGA-01-0001""-""provided""-""GC1234"" is as Statement that uses the Rule ""GenomicCharacterization-obtainedFrom-Sample"").

1473,wl-kg000001922006f4ea,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/wl-kg,The World Literature Knowledge Graph,Digital media have enabled the access to unprecedented literary knowledge. Authors  readers  and scholars are now able to discover and share an increasing amount of information about books and their authors. However  these sources of knowledge are fragmented and do not adequately represent non-Western writers and their works. In this paper we present The World Literature Knowledge Graph  a semantic resource containing 194   346 writers and 965  210 works  specifically designed for exploring facts about literary works and authors from different parts of the world. The knowledge graph integrates information about the reception of literary works gathered from 3 different communities of readers  aligned according to a single semantic model. The resource is accessible through an online visualization platform  which can be found at the following URL: https://literaturegraph.di.unito.it/3. This platform has been rigorously tested and validated by 3 distinct categories of experts who have found it to be highly beneficial for their respective work domains. These categories include teachers  researchers in the humanities  and professionals in the publishing industry. The feedback received from these experts confirms that they can effectively utilize the platform to enhance their work processes and achieve valuable outcomes.,,cultural heritage,,,,

It is now an early example of [a linked data set that has been permanently removed from the Web][1]  since it has been superceded by the U.S. Library of Congress' own [Thesaurus for Graphic Materials][2]  now provided as part of the Library of Congress's linked data services. t4gm.info was unpublished in 2012.    [This page][3] provides a brief [VoiD][4] description of the t4gm.info dataset and its relationship to the equivalent information at id.loc.gov  expressed in RDFa. In addition  this site provides a specific mapping of resources from t4gm.info to id.loc.gov as [a VoiD linkset][5]. Both the VoiD dataset and linkset descriptions can be retrieved through content negotiation in a variety of linked data formats (i.e.  in either RDF/XML  Turtle  or N-Triples.) GET requests for t4gm.info concept resources are redirected as 301 Moved Permanently to the equivalent resource at id.loc.gov.

LusTRE considers the heterogeneity in scopes and levels of abstraction of environmental thesauri as an asset when managing environmental data  it exploits linked data best practices SKOS  (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and RDF  (Resource Description Framework) in order to provide a multi-thesauri solution for INSPIRE data themes related to the environment.   The ThIST content is made available by Geological Survey of Italy in ISPRA  (Istituto Superiore per la  Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale). It is the result of a nearly total revision of the thesaurus born by the integration among the terminological database of the former Library of the Italy Geological Service  and the thesaurus published by the CNR in 1997. ThIST is already used for the cataloguing of the biblio-cartographic material (monographs  articles of periodicals  papers) possessed by the Library and the recovery of the related information.

839,arrayexpress-e-afmx-1,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/arrayexpress-e-afmx-1,"Transcription profiling of human, chimp and mouse brain",Microarray technologies allow the identification of large numbers of expression differences within and between species. Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes  it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore  the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore  it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues.,format-efo; format-pobo; format-prov; lifesciences; lod; no-proprietary-vocab; provenance-metadata; published-by-third-party,health,,,,

1075,viaf,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/viaf,VIAF: The Virtual International Authority File,"VIAF (Virtual International Autority File) is an OCLC dataset and service -- built in cooperation with national libraries and other partners -- that virtually combines multiple LAM (Library Archives Museum) name authority files into a single name authority service. Put simply it is a large database of people and organizations that occur in library catalogs.      VIAF is a joint project of 20  national libraries  implemented and hosted by OCLC. The project's goal is to lower the cost and increase the utility of library authority files by matching and linking the authority files of national libraries  and then making that information available on the Web.    ### Openness    The data is released under Open Data Commons Attribution license. Attribution is requested as follows:    > Adherence to ODC Attribution instructions for the correct assertion of attribution is encouraged. The preferred form of attribution for VIAF is:  >  > ""This [title of report or article or dataset] contains information from VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) which is made available under the ODC Attribution License.""  >   > Special cases: In circumstances where providing the full attribution statement above is not technically feasible  the use of canonical VIAF URIs is adequate to satisfy Section 4.3 of the ODC Attribution License.    #### Older information preserved for archival purposes    OCLC is currently in discussion with partners about how to license material. [Message from Thom Hickey  OCLC Chief Scientist](http://groups.google.com/group/nyt_linked_open_data/browse_thread/thread/46ea00276e3d5a2e#) on public Google Groups mailing list in January 2010 states:    > VIAF is a joint project with the contributing institutions and OCLC doesn?t claim any rights to the data beyond what the group has.  Unfortunately the group as a whole has problems coming up with a statement of exactly what is permitted.  In lieu of that  our position is that the data on the site is freely available for use through the APIs  although if someone wants a copy of the whole thing they would have to apply to the VIAF consortium (they could do that through me or Barbara Tillett at LC).  Along those same lines  if someone is going to have substantial activity against VIAF (multiple queries/second) we?d like to know about it ahead of time.     > Over the next few months we will be working on a better statement of what?s permitted  but our intention is to make the data as freely available as possible (even to the NYT).       Further update from Thom Hickey:  (http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2011/03/use-of-viaf.html)    > I responded to a recent blog post on LibraryThing which mentioned restrictions on the use of VIAF and its relationship to the LC authority file.    > In fact  VIAF is open for use by anyone.  Here's what I said about the use of VIAF:    > VIAF is a project led by LC  the French and German national libraries and OCLC. There are no restrictions on its use. Dumps of the complete file are available  but need the approval of the project leaders.    > VIAF is not designed to replace the LC/NACO authority file  but rather is built from it and a number of similar files.    > I hope that is clear.  We really do want people to use VIAF!

It contains over 40 million mentions of over 3 million entities. Mentions are manually labeled links to respective Wikipedia pages in natural language text. They are obtained via a web crawl and aggregated together with the pages' source in the extended corpus of over 180GB in size.    We took the corpus and converted it into the [NLP Interchange Format (NIF)](http://nlp2rdf.org/)  publishing it here in Linked Open Data  RDF dumps and an accompanying CSV.     Every webpage in the corpus was parsed. The text of the html element surrounding the individual Wikipedia links was extracted and concatenated together  if there was more than one link on the page. The position of the links in these texts was located and annotated via string offsets. The position of the html elements containing the links was annotated with Xpath expressions. For every link to Wikipedia  the respective [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org) page was included as a link. The [DBpedia ontology classes](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Ontology) of the linked resource were added as well. If a mapping exists  [NERD core classes](http://nerd.eurecom.fr/) were added  too.    The data is available in the Apache file system under [http://wiki-link.nlp2rdf.org/data/](http://wiki-link.nlp2rdf.org/data/).

677,wold,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/wold,World Loanword Database,The World Loanword Database  edited by Martin Haspelmath and Uri Tadmor  is a scientific publication by the Max Planck Digital Library  Munich (2009).     It provides vocabularies (mini-dictionaries of about 1000-2000 entries) of 41 languages from around the world  with comprehensive information about the loanword status of each word. It allows users to find loanwords  source words and donor languages in each of the 41 languages  but also makes it easy to compare loanwords across languages.     Each vocabulary was contributed by an expert on the language and its history. An accompanying book is being published by Mouton de Gruyter (Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook  edited by Martin Haspelmath & Uri Tadmor).     The World Loanword Database 2009 consists of vocabularies contributed by 41 different authors or author teams. When citing material from the database  please cite the corresponding vocabulary (or vocabularies).     The database can be accessed by language  by meaning  by author  or by reference.     The World Loanword Database 2009 is the result of a collaborative project coordinated by Uri Tadmor and Martin Haspelmath between 2004 and 2008  called the Loanword Typology Project (LWT). Most of the contributors took part in workshops at which the procedures for selecting and annotating words were discussed extensively. The list of 1460 meanings on which the vocabularies are based is called the Loanword Typology meaning list  and it is in turn based on the list of the Intercontinental Dictionary Series.
