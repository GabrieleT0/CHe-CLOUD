ANNO consists of two components: ANNOdc  a domain-core ontology providing core entities such as basic anatomical categories  and ANNOds  a domain-specific ontology used for annotating structures of the human skeleton. ANNO is integrated into AnthroWorks3D  a photogrammetry pipeline and application for the creation and analysis of 3D-models of human skeletal remains. The integration is based on the three-ontology method with the General Formal Ontology as the top-level ontology  ANNOdc as the task ontology and ANNOds as the domain ontology. Thus  AnthroWorks3D only needs to implement access to the entities (classes and properties) of the task ontology  whereas the entities of the corresponding domain ontology are imported dynamically. ANNO supports the analysis of skeletal and bone finds in forensic and historical anthropology  facilitating the standardization of data annotation and ensuring accurate preservation of information for posterity.,anthropology,health,antropology from the description,,,,cultural heritage,

839,arrayexpress-e-afmx-1,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/arrayexpress-e-afmx-1,"Transcription profiling of human, chimp and mouse brain",Microarray technologies allow the identification of large numbers of expression differences within and between species. Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes  it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore  the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore  it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues.,format-efo; format-pobo; format-prov; lifesciences; lod; no-proprietary-vocab; provenance-metadata; published-by-third-party,health,,,,,,health

The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop  we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy  bio-molecules  chemicals and drugs  pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries.

The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it  (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation  and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,health,,,,,health,SLR

1358,iptc-newscodes,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/iptc-newscodes,IPTC NewsCodes,The IPTC not only provides news exchange formats to the news industry but also creates and maintains sets of concepts to be assigned as metadata values to news objects like text  photographs  graphics  audio- and video files and streams. This allows for a consistent coding of news metadata over the course of time - that's the reason why we call them IPTC NewsCodes.  The universe of NewsCodes is currently split into many different sets - taxonomies - for increased manageability as topics usually relate to a specific area. A taxonomy is also likely to be used exclusively in a specific metadata property of a news exchange format.  To provide an easy overview of our taxonomies further we grouped them into four main areas:  * Descriptive NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies to describe the content of news items  including the key subject classification  IPTC Media Topics (which takes over from the previous IPTC Subject Codes). * Administrative NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies for proper administration of news items. * Transmission NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies with controlled values for the transmission process. * Exchange Format NewsCodes: This is a group of taxonomies with values to support specific functionalities of the different IPTC news exchange format standards. NewsML 1.x  NewsML-G2  EventsML-G2 and SportsML-G2 make use of this feature.   Each NewsCodes vocabulary can be referenced via our site  downloaded as a NewsML-G2 Knowledge Item  or downloaded in SKOS format (with IKOS extensions) in RDF/XML   RDF/Turtle and JSON-LD.  Find more details about our taxonomies on the [Overview page](https://iptc.org/standards/newscodes/).  Any NewsCode provided by the IPTC can be used at any stage of a news workflow without any royalty fee. But if one includes IPTC NewsCodes into an application the intellectual property and the copyright of the IPTC must be explicitly included.,lod; lodcloud.nolinks; lodcloud.unconnected; media; news; published-by-producer; subject;,not classified,,,,,,health

254,neurolex-wiki,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/neurolex-wiki,NeuroLex Wiki,"NeuroLex.org is a freely editable semantic wiki for community-based curation of the terms used in Neuroscience. It is a joint project of the Neuroscience Information Framework and the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility.    This Wiki takes advantage of the Semantic Mediawiki software and the Halo Extension and has loaded all the NIF ontology classes. Many of the annotation properties associated with those classes have been tagged with properties here. Restrictions have not yet been ported over. However  in this current version  most classes just have the NIF id and the parent class/category associated with them.    The Wiki version of the NIF encodes classes as ""categories""  as in the standard Wikipedia. These class categories themselves have editable pages. This therefore allows anyone to update the definitions of the classes.    This Wiki also allows other ""instance"" articles to be tagged with those classes. Properties between classes or between ""instance"" articles can be defined as well. This allows individual terms within ""instance"" articles to be tagged with these properties. There are a few examples of this below.    By tagging parts of a page with a property  a query mechanism can reshuffle the data within those pages in tables or by generating dynamic lists.",lexicon; neuroinformatics; neuroscience; ontology,"linguistic, health",neuroscience in the abstract. linguistic as lexicon is among keywords,,,,health,publication

Plant photo data is the data generated in the process of collecting plant digital images by digital cameras or scanners for wild or cultivated plant groups  including plant images  identification species information  shooting time  location  habitat and other data. Plant image is the most direct way to understand plant characters  and it is also an important material for plant taxonomy and related research. Plant images can not only be used as research data in scientific research  scientific popularization  species identification and other fields  but also the time  location  habitat and other information recorded during shooting or collection can be used as important observation data to effectively supplement the shortcomings of traditional species information collection methods such as plant specimen collection in timeliness and completeness. In addition  the plant image of classification and identification can also be used as the basic data of computer vision technology research for the development of plant image intelligent recognition system and other rapid identification technology.  The directory contains 115788 names  including 45063 accepted names and 70725 synonyms  belonging to 483 families  4253 genera  37689 species and 7374 species.

1176,taxonconcept,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/taxonconcept,TaxonConcept Knowledge Base,Species are known by many different names. The TaxonConcept Knowledge Base provides informative Linked Open Data URI's for species concepts that improve the quality and stability of links between a species and data about that species. There are currently 108 175 species concepts and a and 1 000 records for species occurrences. There are also a few examples of references  and image galleries. I have added links below for an insect  mammal  bird and tree to serve as examples of the interlinking etc. The occurrence records are interlinked with GeoNames.     A species can have several different classifications  for instance it's classification in NCBI and DBpedia  are different. To allow multiple classifications  the species model is separate from any specific classification. However many want these two aspects connected together. To make this easy  I have created an additional owl:sameAs RDF dump file which makes the #Taxonomy the same as the #Species. This is particularly useful for browsing SPARQL query results with Microsoft Pivot. In addition  it is also possible to create similar mapping files that can be used to   tie the species to alternative classifications.
