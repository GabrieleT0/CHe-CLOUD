In order to ensure their fullest possible use  the Identifiers and a formal Statement of Adoption were presented at the second regular session of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB)  in November 2019. At the CEB  the Secretary-General invited all UN organizations to use them to map their SDG-related resources and sign the Statement.  Unique Identifiers for the sustainable development goals  targets and indicators  The system of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for Sustainable Development Goals  Targets  Indicators and related statistical series is now part of the Semantic Web infrastructure that the UN Dag Hammarskjold Library makes available to IT developers and the public at large under http://metadata.un.org/sdg/?lang=en.  It formalizes links between the goals  targets  indicators and series  and two other crucial elements in the Linked Open Data infrastructure maintained by the United Nation System  namely: (1) the UN Bibliographic Information System maintained by the UN Dag Hammarskjold Library  and (2) the SDG Interface Ontology  maintained by UN Environment.   The identifiers allow the use of Semantic Web technologies to:  •             Provide a web-based mechanism to make SDG-related data and information assets accessible  inter-operable and re-usable   •             Organically discover relevant and authoritative SDG data and information among the multitude of available sources on the web  •             Enable the development of applications that integrate authoritative data  concepts and definitions from a large number of formerly unknown sources.

ANNO consists of two components: ANNOdc  a domain-core ontology providing core entities such as basic anatomical categories  and ANNOds  a domain-specific ontology used for annotating structures of the human skeleton. ANNO is integrated into AnthroWorks3D  a photogrammetry pipeline and application for the creation and analysis of 3D-models of human skeletal remains. The integration is based on the three-ontology method with the General Formal Ontology as the top-level ontology  ANNOdc as the task ontology and ANNOds as the domain ontology. Thus  AnthroWorks3D only needs to implement access to the entities (classes and properties) of the task ontology  whereas the entities of the corresponding domain ontology are imported dynamically. ANNO supports the analysis of skeletal and bone finds in forensic and historical anthropology  facilitating the standardization of data annotation and ensuring accurate preservation of information for posterity.,anthropology,health,antropology from the description,,,,cultural heritage,cultural heritage

The following datasets and subsets are available:    * Collections (dataset  short  name: colls)   * Bibliographic Data of the Central Library (subset  short name: colls-lib-bib)    The Bibliographic Data of the Central Library contains the entire online catalogue of the library in BIBFRAME format and provides links to external sources including: [BNF](http://data.bnf.fr)  [ISNI](http://isni.org)  [LC NAF](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html)  [VIAF](http:viaf.org) and [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org).    One of the aims of this publication is to make Hungarian librarians more familiar with BIBFRAME. In order to achieve this the BIBFRAME and the MARC descriptions are cross linked. Knowing the BIBFRAME URI of an instance:    [http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563](http://data.hnm.hu/id/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563)    one can get the MARC description by appending "".opac"" to the URI:    [http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac](http://data.hnm.hu/doc/colls/lib/bib/Instance/MNMKVT19563.opac).    Knowing the permalink of an OPAC record     [http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563)    one can get the BIBRAME description in HTML format by appending .rdf to it:    [http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf](http://link.hnm.hu/lib/bib/MNMKVT19563.rdf).    Other formats can also be invoked by appending the following extensions:  .rdf-ttl  .rdf-nt  .rdf-json  .rdf-jsonld  and .rdf-rdf. The .rdf-rdf extentsion gives back the rdf-xml format.    Clicking the BIBFRAME icon in the OPAC also leads to the BIBFRAME description.    The OPAC pages also support the link rel discovery service in order for the crawlers and other programs to find the RDF descriptions in different formats automatically.    The project was carried out in partnership with @Cult srl.  Italy (MARC BIBFRAME conversion) and Monguz Ltd.  Hungary (OPAC modification). We also used some parts of the ALIADA open source tool.    The @Cult MARC21 BIBFRAME conversion have the following main features:    - Work recognition  - Entity recognition  - Name entities are linked to external datasets.

1518,dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei0000018da796a714,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei,Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND),"GND stands for ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (Integrated Authority File) and offers a broad range of elements to describe authorities. The GND originates from the German library community and aims to solve the name ambiguity problem in the library world. Corresponding data is usually expressed in a customized MARC 21 Authority Format (GND MARC Format) which is quite domain specific and is not used beyond the library and publisher world. The GND ontology tries to bridge this gap by providing a format specification for the usage in the semantic web.  The need for name disambiguity and entries having an authoritative character is an issue that concerns a lot more communities than the library world. In a growing information society the unique identification and linking of persons  places and other authorities becomes more and more important. The GND Ontology aims to transfer the made experience from libraries to the web community by providing a vocabulary for the description of differentiated and undifferentiated persons  conferences or events  corporate bodies  places or geographic names  subject headings  and works.  To ensure compatibility aspects the GND ontology aligns a number of already established vocabularies like the FOAF vocabulary.  The GND is a young specification that probably will underlie certain smaller changes. However  the currently defined classes and properties have a status of stability. But we also expect the introduction of additional elements caused by newly upcoming requirements within the community. From January 2014 on  the Linked Data Service of the German National Library (DNB) will issue scheduled releases and will be integrated in the export releases of the other formats. Changes to the conversion and to the data modelling will be made in January  May and September. Changes will be notified in advance via the Linked Data Service mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/lds) and the Integrated Authority File GND Ontology mailing list (http://lists.dnb.de/mailman/listinfo/gnd-ontology). Please subscribe if you are interested in receiving information about future developments in DNB Linked Data Services. In a schedule corresponding to the export releases  updated dumps of the authority and bibliographic data in RDF/XML and Turtle will be available for download in February  June and October.  The authors welcome comments on this document  preferably via the public GND ontology list; public archives are available.   The Integrated Authority File  The ""Gemeinsame Normdatei"" (GND  Integrated Authority File) brings together the content of the former Corporate Body Authority File GKD (Gemeinsame Körperschaftsdatei)  the Name Authority File PND (Personennamendatei)  the Subject Headings Authority File SWD (Schlagwortnormdatei) and the Uniform Title File of the Deutsches Musikarchiv EST file (Einheitssachtitel-Datei ) to form an integrated authority file.  The target has therefore been reached of setting up an authority file which covers all types of entities and which serves as a common  authoritative reference system for libraries' bibliographic data and for the cataloging data of other authority file users such as archives  museums  projects  scientific and cultural institutions. All library networks in the German-speaking countries and the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB) are involved in the GND project alongside the German National Library.  The GND should consign to the past problems arising from different formats  parallel storage of data records and different rules for descriptive and subject cataloging.  The objective of the GND is to form a modern  web-compatible authority file which is capable of networking the wide range of resources and information held by libraries and other cultural institutions in the German-speaking countries and making these accessible to users. To approach a web-compatible authority file we also provide the GND as linked data. Therefore we developed an independent GND specific vocabulary (GND Ontology) that almost completely covers the offered GND concepts provided in MARC 21.",authorities; bibliographic; buildings; concepts; corporations; crossdomain; format-foaf; format-rdf; format-rdfs; format-skos; germany; lld; lod; no-deref-vocab; no-license-metadata; no-provenance-metadata; no-vocab-mappings; persons; places; published-by-producer; rdf,,,,,,cultural heritage,unclassified

For the UK the NUTS3 level is further aligned to the local administrative units (or LAU) geography provided by http://statistics.data.gov.uk.     The NUTS regions are described along with their temporal validity. Changes in the coding reflect both the changes in the composition of the European Union and the internal reorganization of some areas. Such changes have been extracted by the Eurostat site and represented in linked data format.    The regions belonging to the current version of NUTS has additional links to the shape files (geoJson and KML format) describing their phisical extent.    The number of links to statistics.data.gov.uk is estimated by assuming 200 NUTS codes in the UK with 50 spacerel:contains links each.

All of MASC includes manually validated annotations for sentence boundaries  token  lemma and POS; noun and verb chunks; and named entities (person  location  organization  date). Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus  including full-text annotation for FrameNet frame elements  WordNet sense tags  and Penn Treebank syntactic annotation. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects.      Unlike most freely available corpora including a wide variety of linguistic annotations  MASC contains texts from a broad range of genres.      MASC is an OPEN LANGUAGE DATA resource that can be downloaded by anyone for any purpose. At the same time  it is a resource that will be enhanced by the community  through its contributions of annotations and derived data.    The RDF conversion from GrAF is still in preparation. Below  you can find a preliminary OWL2/DL representation of the PennTreebank syntax (60.000 tok) in OWL  generated out of the original annotations  instead. Triple counts and links refer to this fragment.

1109,model10000018e0765eeca,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/model1,An automatic approach for land-change detection and land updates based on integrated NDVI timing analysis and the CVAPS method with GEE support,Land-use/land-cover information is the basis of global-change research and regional governmental management. Automatic approaches are always required to update land maps for large-scale areas  and change detection techniques are the most important component of land-updating methods. Previous research has confirmed that simple change detection based on Landsat images from two different years with two different phenophases yields unsatisfactory results and may induce many misclassifications and pseudo-change identifications because of the phenological differences between remote sensing images. With the support of the Google Earth Engine (GEE)  we propose a land-use/land-cover type discrimination method based on a classification and regression tree (CART)  apply change-vector analysis in posterior probability space (CVAPS) and the best histogram maximum entropy method for change detection  and further improve the accuracy of the land-updating results in combination with NDVI timing analysis  which indicates the annual growth of ground vegetation. In the case study  we select western China as the research area and obtain a 2014 land map based on the ESA GlobCover 2009 dataset. The results confirm that the accuracy of the land-renewal results based on the CART-CVAPS-NDVI method reach 78.6-88.2%  which is 4-10% higher than that of the CART-CVPAS method without NDVI timing analysis. The CART-CVAPS-NDVI method has more detailed and accurate resolutions for land-change detection.,NDVI; timing analysis,not classified - geography,,,,,,cultural heritage

The triple count (30M) is a rough estimate based on the number of authority records. The LCSH link count is based on the observation that many but not all of the authority records have LCSH links. The Geonames link count is based on [this account](http://www.oclc.org/nextspace/018/research.htm) that states 100k total geographic entities with 60% matched to Geonames.,authorities; format-dc; format-foaf; format-skos; format-void; license-metadata; lod; lodcloud; lodcloud-diagram-2014-08-30; no-proprietary-vocab; provenance-metadata; publications; published-by-producer,not classified,,,,,,cultural heritage

1176,taxonconcept,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/taxonconcept,TaxonConcept Knowledge Base,Species are known by many different names. The TaxonConcept Knowledge Base provides informative Linked Open Data URI's for species concepts that improve the quality and stability of links between a species and data about that species. There are currently 108 175 species concepts and a and 1 000 records for species occurrences. There are also a few examples of references  and image galleries. I have added links below for an insect  mammal  bird and tree to serve as examples of the interlinking etc. The occurrence records are interlinked with GeoNames.     A species can have several different classifications  for instance it's classification in NCBI and DBpedia  are different. To allow multiple classifications  the species model is separate from any specific classification. However many want these two aspects connected together. To make this easy  I have created an additional owl:sameAs RDF dump file which makes the #Taxonomy the same as the #Species. This is particularly useful for browsing SPARQL query results with Microsoft Pivot. In addition  it is also possible to create similar mapping files that can be used to   tie the species to alternative classifications.

LusTRE considers the heterogeneity in scopes and levels of abstraction of environmental thesauri as an asset when managing environmental data  it exploits linked data best practices SKOS  (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and RDF  (Resource Description Framework) in order to provide a multi-thesauri solution for INSPIRE data themes related to the environment.   The ThIST content is made available by Geological Survey of Italy in ISPRA  (Istituto Superiore per la  Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale). It is the result of a nearly total revision of the thesaurus born by the integration among the terminological database of the former Library of the Italy Geological Service  and the thesaurus published by the CNR in 1997.

987,traditional-korean-medicine,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/traditional-korean-medicine,Traditional Korean Medicine Ontology,"Traditional Korean medicine (Hangul: 한의학  Hanja: 韓醫學) developed with the influence of other traditional medicine. Its techniques in treatment and diagnosis are both similar and unique to other traditional medicine. (Visit Wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Korean_medicine.)    ""Ontology-based Traditional Korean Medicine Knowledge Framework"" project is systematization of core knowledge of TKM and enhancing the applicability of the knowledge. This project is supported by Korean government and Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine is pursuing this project since 2009.    To achieve this  our group is constructing ontology for TKM  in particular  patient status and medicinal treatment for them. The center is conceptualizing disease  pattern  symptom and medical test result to define patient status and medicinal materials  formulas  acupuncture and moxibustion for treatment method.

1473,wl-kg000001922006f4ea,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/wl-kg,The World Literature Knowledge Graph,Digital media have enabled the access to unprecedented literary knowledge. Authors  readers  and scholars are now able to discover and share an increasing amount of information about books and their authors. However  these sources of knowledge are fragmented and do not adequately represent non-Western writers and their works. In this paper we present The World Literature Knowledge Graph  a semantic resource containing 194   346 writers and 965  210 works  specifically designed for exploring facts about literary works and authors from different parts of the world. The knowledge graph integrates information about the reception of literary works gathered from 3 different communities of readers  aligned according to a single semantic model. The resource is accessible through an online visualization platform  which can be found at the following URL: https://literaturegraph.di.unito.it/3. This platform has been rigorously tested and validated by 3 distinct categories of experts who have found it to be highly beneficial for their respective work domains. These categories include teachers  researchers in the humanities  and professionals in the publishing industry. The feedback received from these experts confirms that they can effectively utilize the platform to enhance their work processes and achieve valuable outcomes.,,cultural heritage,,,,,cultural heritage,SLR
